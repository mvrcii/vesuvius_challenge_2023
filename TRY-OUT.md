# Things to do
- Roughly understand the core idea of I3D 
- What is a non-local block?
- How did yousef add a non-local-block to the I3D artchitecture?
- Mean Pooling vs. Max Pooling
- "An interesting idea from Julian is to apply the gaussian weighting to the training loss aswell, so the model focuses on the signal it can see, rather than the signal it has no context for."
