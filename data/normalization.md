# Normalization Strategy for Multichannel Images

## Context
- Dealing with training images having multiple channels (e.g., 16 different grayscale channels).
- Each channel potentially comes from different distributions.
- The goal is to normalize these images effectively for machine learning or deep learning models.

## Approach

### Calculation of Mean and Standard Deviation
- **Per-Channel Calculation**: Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each channel independently.
- **Across All Training Images**: Aggregate data across all training images to calculate these statistics.
- **Exclusion of Validation/Test Data**: Do not include validation or test images in this calculation to prevent data leakage and ensure generalization.

### Application of Normalization
- **Consistency Across Datasets**: Apply the calculated per-channel mean and standard deviation to all datasets (training, validation, and test).
- **Normalization Procedure**: For each channel in an image, subtract the per-channel mean and divide by the per-channel standard deviation.

### Rationale
- **Handles Different Distributions**: By normalizing each channel separately, the unique statistical properties of each channel are respected.
- **Generalization**: The model learns to generalize across the combined distribution of all training images.
- **Real-World Scenario Simulation**: Reflects a realistic scenario where only training data is available for preparing the model.

### Implementation Consideration
- Ensure that the normalization process is integrated into both the training pipeline and the preprocessing steps for validation and test data.
